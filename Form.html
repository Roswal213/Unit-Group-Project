            <h4>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Quality pool!</h4>
            <p>From start to finish I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with our pool construction, the end product, and working with you was an absolute pleasure.</p>
            <p>You helped make a dream come true. I feel very fortunate to have chosen Phoenix Pools and Spas for my landscape needs which eventually led to you. In my opinion, you are by far one of the best Pool Builders in the valley. And, I don‚Äôt say this lightly.</p>
            <p>All you need to do is listen to some of my neighbors nightmares they are experiencing because they chose a pool builder other than Specialty Pool. And, if asked, I have no reservations in recommending you to others for their pool building needs. Again, I thank you very much.</p>

            <h4>Bob Ross</h4>
            <h4>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Fantastic Construction.</h4>
            <p>We recently purchased a used home with a large dirt back yard. Because the home required a lot of work inside and out, our budget for a swimming pool was very limited, we wanted a nice but somewhat simple design trying to be realistic with our budget. We got bids from some of the big pool builders in the area and even from a pool builder that a friend of mine works for.</p>
            <p>We were very disappointed to say the least, all of which came up with very bad and plain designs, all were over thousands of dollars over budget. Then we talked to James Blackman at Specialty Pools, by this time we didn‚Äôt expect much. But James came over and put together some plans within our budget and we were ‚ÄúBlown Away‚Äù with what we could afford.</p>
            <p>The design James came up with was better than what we expected and much nicer than the over budget big pool builders submitted. We were new to having a pool built, so James walked us through the process and laid out all the steps involved. The crews that worked on the pool were great and very professional. James was overseeing the project from start to finish and came off without ‚Äúany‚Äù problems. Specialty Pools built our family a place where we spend a lot of time together , we now have a beautiful pool in what used to be a large dirt backyard with 3 waterfalls and wonderful decking. I highly recommend Specialty Pools to everyone who listens, James Blackman built us the pool that we thought we could not afford. Thanks James.</p>

            <h4>‚≠ê - Terrible Customer Service.</h4>
            <p>I needed a pool built in the backyard of my new house, so I came to Phoenix Pools and Spas because it was recommended to me by a friend. The company refused to build a pool in my yard because "there was not enough space". Although there was enough space to have a 6 inch clearance around the outside of the pool to the wall.</p>
            <p>These losers should have taken my money and built me a pool, but they refused to work with me. I would not recommend this company to anyone who wants to work with a competent person and get the job done.</p>
